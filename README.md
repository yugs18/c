## Projects

### 🎲 Simple Dice Game
A command-line gambling game written in C where the player bets money on the outcome of a dice roll. The player wins triple the bet on a correct guess and loses the bet on an incorrect one. The game continues until the player quits or runs out of money.

**Main Points:**
- Uses random number generation
- Implements loops and conditional logic
- Handles user input and validation
- Demonstrates basic game logic and state management

### 🟩 Wordle Game
A command-line implementation of the Wordle game written in C. The program selects a random 5-letter word from a word list, and the player has limited attempts to guess it, receiving colored feedback after each guess.

**Main Points:**
- File handling for loading word lists
- String manipulation and validation
- Use of structs and functions
- ANSI color output for feedback
- Game loop and input validation
